This is a fully responsive and dynamic Library Management System where a user can manage his library. A person/admin can create new books and manage books in different locations, manage fines, approve/cancel the book issue, manage the listed users, etc. On the other hand, a person/user/student can create a new account for the library and search for their favorite book. If he finds it then he/she can issue the book. Some of the screenshot from the web app is listed below
